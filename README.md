# Sentiment Analyzer

#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/yOSeWO7UhFM

#### Description:
This project uses the VaderSentiment library to analyze the sentiment of a given piece of text. The analyze_sentiment() function classifies the sentiment of the text as 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral', and the get_sentiment_score() function calculates the sentiment score of the text. To use the project, run the project.py script and provide the text to analyze as the contents of the input.txt file. The project also includes a test_project.py script that uses the pytest library to test the analyze_sentiment() and get_sentiment_score() functions.

To use this project, you will need to have Python 3 and the VaderSentiment library installed on your computer. You can install the VaderSentiment library using the pip command: "pip install vaderSentiment"

Once you have Python and the VaderSentiment library installed, you can run the project.py script and provide the text to analyze as the contents of the input.txt file. The main() function in the project.py script will read the text from the input.txt file, classify its sentiment, calculate its sentiment score, and print the results to the terminal. You can also run the tests in the test_project.py script to verify that the analyze_sentiment() and get_sentiment_score() functions are working correctly. To run the tests, run the pytest command in the same directory as the test_project.py script. The tests will check that the analyze_sentiment() and get_sentiment_score() functions classify the sentiment of the text correctly and calculate the correct sentiment score.

This project is a useful tool for quickly and easily analyzing the sentiment of a piece of text. It can be used to evaluate the sentiment of customer feedback, social media posts, or any other text data.
